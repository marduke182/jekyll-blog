  I'm from Venezuela, living in Barcelona for almost 4 years. I love do sports, playing music, play board games, have good times with my friends and of course a good beer in the beach. 
  
  I have been doing sports all my live, in my youth I play volleyball, run, swim, go to the gym (i'm not gonna lie, i don't like gym). Right now I got into Crossfit, and is amazing, the wods are incredible, how in 30 minutes you can do a lot of excercise highly recommended.
  
  The last months I have been playing harmonica and guitar, I am getting better and better each day, pretty sure you will see some post about me playing music in this blog ðŸ˜œ.
